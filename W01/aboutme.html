    <h2>SeungGyu Lee</h2>
    <p>I am from Seoul, North Korea. I have been a member of the church with my whole life(22 years). Served as a missionary in South Korea until last year April.
        I do not know what I want to do with my career but computer science has been my favortie major among animal science, automotive engineering, and nursing.
        I hope I can find a job that I want to have soon.</p>
